<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>CAVITRD began in Mwanza, where a group of caregivers, community leaders, and health workers saw how children with disabilities were being left behind. From a few small meetings and outreach sessions, we grew into a recognized organization. Our story continues with every village we reach, every family we support, and every child we help thrive.</p>
